In the Case Management System, every case contains structured hearing data including Case Number, Case Type, Filing Date, Parties, Court Assignment Status, Total Hearings, and a complete hearing timeline. While generating a case timeline, the system first predicts or defines the total number of hearings required (for example, “Predicted Case Timeline: 14 Hearings Required”). This predicted hearing count becomes the master hearing count for that case. The exact same number of hearings generated at the prediction stage must be created, stored, and displayed consistently across all modules, especially in the Case Status View and Timeline History sections. Under no circumstance should there be a mismatch between predicted hearings and displayed hearings. For example, if 14 hearings are generated during timeline creation, then the Case View timeline must also display all 14 hearings, not fewer such as 5 or none.

The Case Information view page must display all case metadata at the top, followed by a Timeline History section that lists every hearing sequentially from Hearing 1 to Hearing 14 with their scheduled dates and times. The timeline container must be vertically scrollable to ensure all hearings are visible without truncation. The case view page is strictly a display interface and must not contain action buttons like “Mark Completed,” “Mark Adjourned,” or “Mark Delayed.” Instead, each hearing should display a circular progress indicator showing its status: a tick mark inside the circle for Completed, a filled colored circle for Adjourned, and a blank circle for Pending or Delayed.

All progress updates must be handled inside the dedicated Update Progress module, accessible via the “Update Progress” button. This screen must again display the same full hearing count generated during prediction, maintaining synchronization with the Case Status View. The update workflow must follow strict sequential logic, meaning Hearing 1 must be updated before Hearing 2 becomes eligible, Hearing 2 before Hearing 3, and so on. On each hearing date, the user must update status by selecting either “Mark as Completed” or “Mark as Adjourned,” and both actions must require password authentication using the default password “admin.” Upon successful password entry, Completed hearings display a tick mark, Adjourned hearings display a filled circle, and if no action is taken on the hearing date, the system must automatically mark the hearing as Delayed, leaving the circle blank.

Once any hearing status is updated, the progress must synchronize across the entire platform, including dashboards, analytics, reports, and case monitoring modules. Past hearings become locked, future hearings remain inaccessible, and only the current eligible hearing is editable. This ensures that the predicted hearing count, generated timeline, displayed case status timeline, and progress update workflow all remain fully synchronized, sequentially controlled, password-secured, and visually consistent throughout the system.
