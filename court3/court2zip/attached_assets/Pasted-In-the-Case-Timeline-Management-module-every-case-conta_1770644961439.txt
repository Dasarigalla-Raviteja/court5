In the Case Timeline Management module, every case contains a predicted and system-generated number of hearings (for example, 14 hearings), and all generated hearings must be displayed in the Timeline History section in a vertically scrollable format without limiting the visible count. The Case Status View page should display case metadata at the top, including Case Number, Parties, Filing Date, Court Status, and Total Hearings, followed by the Timeline History section showing each hearing sequentially with date, time, and status indicators such as Upcoming, Completed, Adjourned, or Delayed.

The Update Progress button must be positioned on the right side of the “Timeline History (Manage Timeline)” header, aligned horizontally with the section title. This placement ensures the action is contextually tied to the timeline module and easily accessible without requiring the user to scroll to the bottom. The button should remain enabled only when at least one hearing is eligible for status update based on sequential progression rules. If no hearings are eligible (for example, all are future hearings or previous hearings are not yet completed), the button may appear disabled with an informational tooltip such as “No hearings eligible for update.”

When the user clicks the Update Progress button, the system must open a dedicated Update Progress interface displaying the Case Number at the top and the complete hearing timeline below in a scrollable vertical structure. Unlike the Case Status View page, this screen allows hearing status modification. Updates must follow strict sequential logic, meaning Hearing 1 must be updated first, and only after it is marked Completed or Adjourned does Hearing 2 unlock, followed by Hearing 3, continuing incrementally until the final hearing. Future hearings must remain locked and visually disabled.

On the scheduled hearing date, the eligible hearing can be updated by selecting either “Mark as Completed” or “Mark as Adjourned,” and both actions must require password authentication using the default password “admin.” Upon successful password validation, Completed hearings display a tick mark inside the circle indicator, Adjourned hearings display a filled colored circle, and if no action is taken on the hearing date, the system must automatically classify the hearing as Delayed, leaving the circle blank. Once updated, the hearing status must synchronize across all system modules including Case Status View, dashboards, monitoring systems, analytics, and reports, ensuring consistent progress tracking everywhere.

The hearing count displayed in the timeline must always match the predicted hearings generated during case timeline creation, ensuring no mismatch between predicted timeline data and case monitoring views. This right-aligned Update Progress button, sequential update workflow, password-secured status marking, and synchronized timeline display together form the complete hearing progress management logic for every case in the system.
