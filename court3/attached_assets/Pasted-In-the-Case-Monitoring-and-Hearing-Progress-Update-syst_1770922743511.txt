In the Case Monitoring and Hearing Progress Update system, hearings must strictly follow sequential progression logic, where the next hearing becomes eligible for updates only after the previous hearing has been fully completed. Currently, the system is allowing future hearings to remain active even when the current hearing is marked as Adjourned, which breaks the judicial workflow because an adjourned hearing indicates that the case has been paused and not concluded.

To correct this behavior, the system must enforce a strict pause-and-lock mechanism whenever a hearing is marked as Adjourned. If the current hearing status is Adjourned, the case must automatically enter a Paused state, and all subsequent hearings in the timeline must immediately become locked and non-editable. These locked hearings must remain visible for reference but must not display any update action buttons such as Mark Completed, Mark Adjourned, Mark Delayed, or Dispose Case. Instead, they should display a status label such as “Blocked – Previous Hearing Adjourned” or “Locked Until Adjourned Hearing is Completed.”

For the adjourned hearing itself, the interface must display a Resume Hearing button, which acts as the only actionable control. Until this Resume Hearing action is triggered and the adjourned hearing is eventually marked as Completed (or the case is Disposed), the system must not unlock the next hearing. Simply resuming the hearing should reactivate its update buttons, but progression to the next hearing should occur only after the resumed hearing is marked Completed.

In summary, the system must enforce the following sequential dependency rules: If the current hearing is Completed, the next hearing becomes active. If the current hearing is Adjourned, the case is paused and all future hearings remain locked. If the adjourned hearing is resumed but not yet completed, future hearings must still remain locked. Only when the current hearing reaches a final state (Completed or Case Disposed) should the system allow progression to the next hearing. This ensures procedural accuracy, prevents premature updates, and maintains real-world judicial sequence integrity across the monitoring workflow.
