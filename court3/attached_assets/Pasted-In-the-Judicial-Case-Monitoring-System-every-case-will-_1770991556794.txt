In the Judicial Case Monitoring System, every case will have a predicted total number of hearings generated by the AI model at the time of timeline creation. Let us assume a case has N total hearings in its master hearing plan. The system must intelligently monitor the case progress and introduce a completion decision checkpoint before the case reaches its final stage. This checkpoint must always be triggered at the N-2 hearing, meaning two hearings before the predicted final hearing. For example, if a case has 14 hearings, the checkpoint will appear at the 12th hearing; if it has 10 hearings, it will appear at the 8th hearing.

When the N-2 hearing becomes active in the Update Progress timeline view and the admin or judge marks that hearing as completed, the system must automatically display a highlighted completion checkpoint panel directly below that hearing card. This panel should ask a clear decision question such as: “Do you expect this case to be completed within the remaining hearings?” and must provide two action buttons: “Yes – Continue Schedule” and “No – Reschedule Required.” The UI must be inline within the timeline (not a popup) so that the workflow remains smooth and contextual.

If the user selects Yes, the system will not make any structural changes. The remaining hearings will continue exactly as originally scheduled, and the case will proceed normally toward the final hearing. However, if the user selects No, it means the predicted hearings are insufficient. In that case, the system must open a structured rescheduling form asking the admin or judge to enter how many additional hearings are required along with a mandatory reason for the extension.

Once the reschedule request is confirmed, the system must dynamically extend the timeline by adding the specified number of hearings after the last existing hearing. These new hearings must be auto-generated using the same scheduling gap logic (for example, bi-weekly or monthly intervals as per the existing plan). All newly added hearings must be labeled with the status “Rescheduled.”

After rescheduling occurs, the system must immediately update the revised total hearing count everywhere across the platform. This includes the Case Overview panel, where Total Hearings must reflect the new number; the Timeline Header, which should show the updated predicted hearing requirement; the Case Monitoring Table stage column, which should now calculate progress against the new total; the Dashboard statistics such as On Track, Warning, and Delayed counts; and the Reports module analytics. In short, the updated hearing count must be globally synchronized so that no module continues to display the old total.

Even after rescheduling, the intelligent checkpoint logic must continue to function. The system must again calculate the new checkpoint using the same formula (New Total Hearings – 2). When the case reaches this new N-2 hearing, the completion checkpoint question must appear again, allowing repeated extensions if necessary. This recursive checkpoint mechanism ensures that long or complex cases can be extended multiple times while maintaining monitoring intelligence.

Additionally, if the admin had previously selected “Yes – Continue Schedule” at the checkpoint but the case still does not get disposed by the final hearing, the system must trigger a fallback decision panel at the last hearing. This panel should ask whether the case has been disposed. If Yes, the case will be closed normally. If No, the system must again allow the admin to enter additional hearings, and the timeline must extend further using the same rescheduling mechanism.

From a UI perspective, the entire flow must remain clean and guided. Checkpoints should use warning styling, rescheduled hearings should have a distinct color or badge, and the decision panels must appear inline within the timeline so that judges or administrators can take action without navigating away. All extensions, decisions, and hearing additions must also be logged in the system audit trail for reporting and transparency.

This complete logic ensures that the monitoring system remains predictive, adaptive, and realistic to real-world court proceedings by allowing dynamic hearing extensions, repeated completion forecasting, and full system-wide synchronization of updated hearing counts.
